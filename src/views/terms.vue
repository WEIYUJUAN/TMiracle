    <h1 id="service">TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        By consenting to these revised Service Terms ("Service Terms"), you
        ("you" or "user") agree to be bound by the conditions outlined when you
        use this website or any section of the TokenMarvel platform (hereafter
        referred to as the "Platform"). These Service Terms, subject to
        modification, establish a binding agreement between you and TokenMarvel,
        Inc. ("TokenMarvel," "we," "our team," or "us"). Governed by these
        Service Terms are your access and use of our various web portals and
        user interfaces (collectively termed as the "Interface"), which are
        designed for facilitating interactions with the diverse offerings and
        services we provide. This includes TokenMarvel's advanced protocol on
        the Ethereum blockchain (the "Protocol"), along with its related content
        and functionalities available through our web domains, such as
        https://www.tokenmarvel.com/, and other web properties managed by
        TokenMarvel where these Service Terms are applicable (collectively known
        as the "Platform"). Additionally, these Service Terms encompass our
        related technologies, combining the Interface, Protocol, and Platform,
        and including all existing and future updates, features,
        functionalities, and technologies, now collectively referred to as the
        "Service").
      </p>
      <p>
        All access and use of the Service is subject to the terms and conditions
        contained in these Terms of Service. By accessing, browsing, or
        otherwise using the Site, the Interface, or any other aspect of the
        Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be
        bound by these Terms of Service. If you are using the Service on behalf
        of an entity or other organization, you are agreeing to these Terms of
        Service for that entity or organization and representing to TokenMarvel
        that you have the authority to bind that entity or organization to these
        Terms of Service (and, in which case, the terms “you” and “your” will
        refer to that entity or organization). If you do not accept the terms
        and conditions of these Terms of Service, you will not access, browse or
        otherwise use the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hold the exclusive right to alter or amend any part of these Terms of
        Service at our discretion. In the event of such changes, we will post
        the revised Terms of Service on the Site and indicate the date of the
        latest update at the top of this page. You can access a current and
        valid version of these Terms of Service by visiting the “Terms of
        Service” link on the Site. Your ongoing use of the Service after the
        effective date of these changes signifies your acceptance of the updated
        Terms of Service. It is advisable to regularly check this page to stay
        informed about any modifications to the Terms of Service. If you
        disagree with these or any future revisions to the Terms of Service, you
        should refrain from accessing, browsing, or using the Service. Moreover,
        as outlined elsewhere in these Terms of Service, you acknowledge that we
        are not liable to you or any third party for any losses incurred due to
        any changes or amendments to this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is essential to review these Terms of Service attentively, as they
        encompass a crucial arbitration agreement and detailed information about
        your legal rights, remedies, and responsibilities. The arbitration
        agreement mandates (with few exceptions) that any disputes you may have
        against us be resolved through binding and final arbitration.
        Additionally, this agreement specifies that (1) you can only assert
        claims against us on an individual basis, not as a party or class member
        in any collective or representative legal proceedings, (2) your pursuit
        of remedies (including monetary compensation, injunctive, and
        declaratory relief) must also be on an individual basis, and (3) you
        might be unable to have any disputes you have against us settled by a
        jury or in a court of law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy Considerations: For comprehensive details about how we gather,

        the Service, you are giving your consent to our practices of collecting,

        Privacy Policy. These practices are an integral part of these Terms of

        Supplementary Conditions: Moreover, the use of specific features within
        the Service may be governed by additional terms. These terms, pertinent
        to certain features, may be posted periodically within the Service. All
        such additional terms are integrated into these Terms of Service by
        reference, thereby forming part of the overall agreement.

        activities conducted with your wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tax and Regulatory Responsibilities: You understand that there may be
        tax and regulatory risks associated with using the Service. It is your
        sole responsibility to determine and comply with tax obligations and to
        stay informed about legal and regulatory changes affecting digital
        assets, bridging, the protocol, or other aspects of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, you acknowledge that TokenMarvel is not liable for any risks
        or losses associated with your use of the Service.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="limitation">Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>
        You expressly understand and agree that TokenMarvel and its associated
        parties will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
        consequential, or exemplary damages, or for damages for loss of profits,
        goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, even if advised of such
        possibilities. This encompasses damages resulting from the use or
        inability to use the Service; costs of substitute goods and services
        from transactions made through the Service; unauthorized access or
        alteration of your data; conduct of any third party on the Service;
        interruption or cessation of functions related to the Interface;
        transmission of bugs, viruses, or harmful code; errors or omissions in
        content made available through the Interface; or any other matters
        relating to the Service. TokenMarvel's total liability to you for all
        damages, losses, and causes of action will not exceed the greater of the
        amount you have paid TokenMarvel in the last six months or one hundred
        dollars ($100).
      </p>
      <p>
        Jurisdictional Limitations: The limitations of liability might not apply
        if prohibitions on the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation
        of liability for incidental or consequential damages exist in your
        jurisdiction. If you are dissatisfied with the Service or these Terms of
        Service, discontinuation of the Service is your sole and exclusive
        remedy. For New Jersey users, the sections titled “Disclaimer of
        Warranties; Assumption of Risk” and “Limitation of Liability” are
        intended to align with New Jersey law. The invalidity of any part of
        these sections under New Jersey law does not affect the validity of the
        remaining portions.

    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="binding">Binding Arbitration Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        This section, known as the "Arbitration Agreement," is a crucial part of
        these Terms of Service. It stipulates that any disputes or claims that
        may arise between you and TokenMarvel, be they related to the Terms of
        Service, the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of your
        relationship or transactions with TokenMarvel, shall be resolved
        exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.
        However, you retain the right to bring individual claims in small claims
        court if they qualify.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Arbitration Agreement does not prevent you from raising issues with
        federal, state, or local agencies. These agencies may seek relief
        against TokenMarvel on your behalf if permitted by law. By agreeing to
        these Terms of Service, both you and TokenMarvel waive the right to a
        trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit. Instead, a
        neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury, will determine your rights. The
        Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of
        this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="prohibition">Prohibition of Collective Legal Actions</h2>
      <p>
        In this agreement, you and TokenMarvel acknowledge and agree that claims
        against each other can only be made on an individual basis. This means
        neither party can participate as a plaintiff or class member in any
        class or representative legal action or proceeding. Unless both parties
        agree otherwise, the arbitrator will not combine more than one
        individual's or party's claims, nor will they oversee any type of
        consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the arbitrator is limited to awarding relief (including
        monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) solely to the individual
        party seeking it and only to the extent necessary to address the
        specific needs of that individual's claim(s). However, it's noted that
        you may pursue a claim for, and the arbitrator may award, public
        injunctive relief under applicable law, as required for the
        enforceability of this provision.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2 id="prearbitration">Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution Process</h2>
      <p>
        TokenMarvel is dedicated to resolving disputes in a friendly and
        efficient manner. Should you have any concerns or issues, they can often
        be swiftly and satisfactorily addressed by reaching out to TokenMarvel's
        customer support team at support@tokenmarvel.com. This initial step is
        encouraged as it often leads to a quick resolution that meets the
        customer's needs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="arbitration">Arbitration Procedures</h2>
      <p>
        Arbitration Process: Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral
        arbitrator following the rules and procedures of the American
        Arbitration Association (“AAA”), which include the AAA's Consumer
        Arbitration Rules. These are collectively referred to as the “AAA Rules”
        and will be modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For details about
        the AAA and its rules, you can visit https://www.adr.org. Specific
        information about AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes is available
        at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arbitration Agreement and AAA Rules: If there is a discrepancy between
        the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this
        Arbitration Agreement will prevail, unless the arbitrator finds that
        applying the inconsistent terms of the Arbitration Agreement would
        result in an unfair arbitration process. The arbitrator is expected to
        follow these Terms of Service as a court would.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scope and Enforceability: The arbitrator will decide all issues,
        including those related to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability
        of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration process is generally
        simpler than court trials, but the arbitrator has the authority to award
        the same damages and relief as a court could under these Terms of
        Service and applicable law. The arbitrator's decisions are enforceable
        in court and can only be overturned by a court in very limited
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Location and Format of Hearings: Unless TokenMarvel and you agree
        otherwise, arbitration hearings will be held at a location that is
        reasonably convenient for both parties, considering travel capabilities
        and other relevant factors. If a mutual agreement on the location cannot
        be reached, AAA will make the decision. For claims of $10,000 or less,
        TokenMarvel agrees to your choice of conducting the arbitration based
        solely on documents submitted, through a telephonic hearing, or an
        in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. For claims exceeding
        $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decision and Award: The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written
        decision detailing the essential findings and conclusions on which the
        award is based, regardless of the arbitration method.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality Agreement in Arbitration</h2>
      <p>
        Under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, all elements of the
        arbitration proceedings, including any rulings, decisions, or awards
        made by the arbitrator, are to be kept strictly confidential. This
        confidentiality clause is for the benefit and protection of all parties
        involved in the arbitration process. This means that the details of the
        arbitration, including the conduct of the proceedings and the outcomes,
        are not to be disclosed to any outside parties, ensuring privacy and
        discretion for all involved.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="severability">Severability Clause in Arbitration Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        This clause establishes that if any part of this Arbitration Agreement,
        except for the "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
        Non-Individualized Relief" section, is found invalid or unenforceable by
        a court or arbitrator, the parties will replace the affected term or
        provision with one that is valid and enforceable. This new term or
        provision should closely match the intent of the original invalid or
        unenforceable one. The modified Arbitration Agreement will then remain
        in effect with these changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if the specific provisions in the "Prohibition of Class and
        Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" section are deemed
        invalid or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration Agreement will become
        null and void. This nullification will occur unless the invalidity or
        unenforceability relates solely to claims for public injunctive relief.
        In the event of nullification, the rest of the Terms of Service will
        still be applicable and in force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement: TokenMarvel acknowledges that,
        despite any other provision in these Terms of Service, if it makes any
        future amendments to this Arbitration Agreement (excluding changes to
        the Notice Address), you, as a user of the Service, have the right to
        reject such changes. To do so, you must send written notice to
        TokenMarvel within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice
        Address specified earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        By choosing to reject any future changes, you are affirming your
        agreement to resolve any disputes between us in accordance with the
        terms of this Arbitration Agreement as it was worded at the time you
        first accepted these Terms of Service, or as they were at the time you
        accepted any subsequent modifications to these Terms of Service. This
        provision ensures that you have a say in any significant alterations to
        the way disputes are handled between you and TokenMarvel in the future.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="disputes">User Disputes Clause</h2>
      <p>
        In this clause, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely
        responsible for your interactions with other users within the scope of
        the Service. TokenMarvel will not bear any liability or responsibility
        for these interactions. While TokenMarvel reserves the right to involve
        itself in disputes between you and other users of the Service, it is
        under no obligation to do so. This means that while using the Service,
        the management and resolution of any conflicts or issues that arise in
        your dealings with other users fall entirely under your purview, without
        expectation of intervention or assistance from TokenMarvel.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="general">General Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service, along with any referenced terms, form the entire
        agreement between you and TokenMarvel, governing your use of the Service
        and superseding any prior agreements related to the Service. You may
        also be subject to additional terms when using third-party services,
        content, or software. These Terms of Service are governed by the laws of
        the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles. For
        any disputes or claims not covered by arbitration, you and TokenMarvel
        agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts in New
        York, New York. The failure of TokenMarvel to exercise or enforce any
        right or provision of these Terms of Service does not constitute a
        waiver of such right or provision. If a court finds any provision of
        these Terms of Service invalid, the parties agree that the court should
        try to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
        provision, while the other provisions remain in full force and effect.
        Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the
        Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one year after
        such claim or cause of action arose, or be forever barred. A printed
        version of these Terms of Service and any notice given in electronic
        form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings, to
        the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
        documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
        form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior
        written consent of TokenMarvel, but TokenMarvel may assign or transfer
        these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The section titles in these Terms of Service are included for
        convenience only and do not have any legal or contractual effect. The
        terms "include," "including," and their variations are not intended as
        terms of limitation and should be interpreted to be followed by "without
        limitation." Notices regarding these Terms of Service or other relevant
        matters may be communicated to you via email or regular mail, and the
        Service may also provide notices of changes to these Terms of Service or
        other important issues by displaying such notices or links to notices on
        the Service. TokenMarvel will not be considered in default or breach of
        these Terms of Service due to any failure or delay in performance caused
        by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not
        limited to civil disturbances, riots, epidemics, hostilities, wars,
        terrorist attacks, embargoes, natural disasters, acts of God, floods,
        fires, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power,
        network access or equipment, or other similar circumstances or causes.
